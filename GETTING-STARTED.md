# 🎯 Claude-Tasker - Getting Started

## What You're Seeing (Current Issues)

Based on your screenshot, you're experiencing exactly what we expected:

1. **Web UI not accessible** - The old system doesn't have a proper web server
2. **Tasks running but no Claude interaction** - It's using legacy mode without Claude SDK
3. **Console shows activity but no real execution** - File-based triggers without actual Claude control

## The Solution: Claude SDK Integration

The breakthrough we just implemented is the **Claude SDK integration** - this is what actually enables programmatic control of Claude.

## Quick Fix (2 minutes)

### 1. Run the Quick Setup
```bash
cd /path/to/claude-tasker
./quick-setup.sh
```

### 2. Add Your Claude API Key
```bash
# Edit the .env file
nano ~/.claude-tasker/.env

# Uncomment and add your API key:
CLAUDE_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-your-actual-key-here
```

Get your API key from: https://console.anthropic.com/

### 3. Restart with New System
```bash
# Stop the old system (Ctrl+C)
# Start the new integrated system
./start.sh
```

## What Changes Now

### Before (What You Saw)
- ❌ No web UI access
- ❌ File-based triggers only
- ❌ No actual Claude execution
- ❌ Legacy simulation mode

### After (With Claude SDK)
- ✅ **Working web UI** at http://localhost:8080
- ✅ **Real Claude execution** via SDK
- ✅ **True autonomous operation**
- ✅ **Programmatic Claude control**

## How It Works Now

1. **Add Task** → Web UI or CLI adds task to queue
2. **Task Manager** → Detects new task and calls Claude SDK
3. **Claude SDK** → Sends task to Claude API programmatically
4. **Claude Executes** → Actually runs commands, creates files, etc.
5. **Results Logged** → Execution results stored and displayed

## Verification

After setup, you should see:
```bash
🎯 Starting Claude-Tasker...
✅ Claude SDK initialized successfully
🚀 Using Claude SDK for true autonomous execution
🌐 Web interface: http://localhost:8080
```

The web UI will show:
- ✅ **Claude SDK Connected** - Autonomous execution enabled

## The Critical Difference

### Old System (File-Based)
```
Task → File → Hook → Simulation → Fake Completion
```

### New System (Claude SDK)
```
Task → Queue → Claude SDK → Real Execution → Actual Results
```

## Troubleshooting

### Web UI Still Not Working
- Make sure you're using the new `start.sh` script
- Check if port 8080 is available
- Look for "Starting web interface..." message

### Tasks Not Executing
- Verify API key is correct in `~/.claude-tasker/.env`
- Check for "Claude SDK initialized successfully" message
- Look for "Using Claude SDK for true autonomous execution"

### Old Behavior Persists
- Make sure you stopped the old system completely
- Use the new `start.sh` script, not the old approach
- Verify the `claude-sdk-executor.py` file exists

## Files Updated

The key files that enable this breakthrough:

1. **`claude-sdk-executor.py`** - The core SDK integration (NEW)
2. **`task-manager.py`** - Updated with SDK integration
3. **`web-server.py`** - Proper web interface (NEW)
4. **`start.sh`** - Integrated startup script (NEW)
5. **`quick-setup.sh`** - Easy setup helper (NEW)

## This Is The Missing Piece!

What you experienced before was exactly the limitation we identified - the UI alone cannot control Claude. The **Claude SDK integration** is what bridges that gap and enables true autonomous execution.

The system you're seeing in your screenshot is the "before" state. Once you add the Claude API key and restart with the new system, you'll have the fully autonomous Claude execution we've been working toward!
